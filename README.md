Hi 

My name is Kamil Kiliasi≈Ñski

Few words about this project
First of all I was wondering if I can handle it using the shadow DOM, eventually I rejected this idea. I decided to use functional programming instead of OOP because in modern coding composition are better than inheritance (you can more split the code into small pieces) - of course, this project is a small... Overall it was a nice challenge to create this app.
