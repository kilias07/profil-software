Hi 

My name is Kamil Kiliasi≈Ñski

Few words about this project
At the beginning I was wondering if I can handle it using the shadow DOM, eventually I rejected this idea. I decided to use functional programming instead of OOP because in modern coding composition is better than inheritance (you can split the code into small pieces) - of course, this project is small... Overall it was a nice challenge to create this app. Unfortunately I don't have enough time to finish this project that will be in line with my project expectations but the basics are accomplished, exept responsive version...
